# K-Means-Clustering-with-python-
This repository contains an implementation of the K-Means Clustering algorithm using Python and popular data science libraries. The project demonstrates how to group unlabeled data into clusters based on their features.

## 📁 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to apply **K-Means Clustering** to a dataset and visually analyze the results. The notebook guides you through:
- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Preprocessing data
- Applying the K-Means algorithm
- Finding the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
- Visualizing the clustered data

## 🔍 Key Concepts
- **Unsupervised Learning**: No labels are provided; the algorithm groups similar data points.
- **K-Means Algorithm**: Partitions data into K clusters based on distance metrics.
- **Elbow Method**: A technique used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Visualization
The project includes scatter plots and cluster visualizations to show how data points are grouped.

## Conclusion
In this project, I have implemented the most popular unsupervised clustering technique called K-Means Clustering.
I have applied the elbow method and find that k=2 (k is number of clusters) can be considered a good number of cluster to cluster this data.
I have find that the model has very high inertia of 237.7572. So, this is not a good model fit to the data.
I have achieved a weak classification accuracy of 1% with k=2 by our unsupervised model.
So, I have changed the value of k and find relatively higher classification accuracy of 62% with k=4.
Hence, we can conclude that k=4 being the optimal number of clusters.
